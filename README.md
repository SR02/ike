'Ike: A binary exploitation and reversing handbook

## About

Welcome to `'Ike`! This handbook is intended to take those with 0 system hacking experience (that's right 0), and get them to an entry level point within the [pwn.college](https://pwn.college) ecosystem. By following these steps, you can establish a strong base upon which to build your future hacking knowledge on. This process will essentially provide you with your white belt in hacking (at a system level) which will only be enhanced within the subsequent pwn.college program. While this handbook leans into the CTF atmosphere commonly seen on sites like [CTFTime](https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/), the content should prove insightful to those curious individuals with no CTF experience (if you are looking for web skills, look somehwere else :D). If you
get some usage out of this handbook, I ask you to hmu with a star on the [github repo](https://github.com/mahaloz/ike), so I know people actually use 
this, lol.

The site with the full hosted book is at [ikr.mahaloz.re](https://ike.mahaloz.re), check it out.

## Contributing

Since I am bad with GitHub actions, currently I make changes to the markdown, then build it with `mdbook build` and push the html to the `gh-pages`
branch. I do all of this with the script `push_book.sh`. If you have changes, simply **make a pull request to the master branch only**. 
I will then push the html changes to the `gh-pages` branch.
