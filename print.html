<h2><a class="header" href="#introduction" id="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>Welcome to <code>'Ike</code> (pronounced Eeh-Kay). This handbook is intended to take those with 0 system hacking experience (that's right 0), and get them to an entry-level point within the <a href="https://pwn.college">pwn.college</a> ecosystem. By following these steps, you can establish a strong base upon which to build your future hacking knowledge on. This process will essentially provide you with your white belt in hacking (at a system level), which will only be enhanced within the subsequent pwn.college program. While this handbook leans into the CTF atmosphere commonly seen on sites like <a href="https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/">CTFTime</a>, the content should prove insightful to those curious individuals with no CTF experience (if you are looking for web skills, look somewhere else :D). If you
get some usage out of this handbook, I ask you to hmu with a star on the <a href="https://github.com/mahaloz/ike">github repo</a>, so I know people actually use this, lol.</p>
<p>Through this <code>Introduction</code> section, you will find meta-data about the handbook, why it was written,
and what I hope to accomplish with it as well as the target audience. </p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#about" id="about">About</a></h2>
<p>As <a href="https://zionbasque.com">president</a> of the <a href="http://asuhacking.club">ASU Hacking Club</a>, I have seen a common trend with regards to incoming club recruits. They tend to be driven Freshman or Sophomores who have yet to take the necessary classwork or gain the necessary experience to easily transition into the pwn.college infrastructure. While I currently occupy a leadership position in ASU-HC and Shellphish, I was once in the same position as many of our struggling recruits. Ideally, this perspective should allow me to offer the necessary resources when getting started in ones “hacking” career. I would hope that the following material also helps those occupying an even earlier academic background. If you find any spelling errors or suggestions, feel free to PR me on <a href="https://github.com/mahaloz/ike">github</a>, or just contact me directly on discord: <code>mahaloz#1337</code>. </p>

<h1><a class="header" href="#background" id="background">Background</a></h1>
<h2><a class="header" href="#the-education-gap" id="the-education-gap">The Education Gap</a></h2>
<p>Over the course of my ever-evolving CTF career, I've seen various methods for getting started in hacking. There are the classic &quot;getting started&quot; guides (ex. this blog), and then there are the more novel interactive frameworks (ex. pwn.college). Many of my peers tend to lean more towards interactive experiences via CTFs, but there have also been sizable portions on the team that has not. In either case, I think there is a small but impactful knowledge gap when following an official &quot;curriculum&quot; instead of creating one yourself.</p>
<p>To help those cross the aforementioned gap, pwn.college was created. By investing time in pwn.college, one would ideally obtain their &quot;yellow belt&quot; in hacking, with the end result being a set of skills that will help you shape your own future learning curriculum. At this time, the Arizona State University class that uses the pwn.college framework (taught by <a href="https://www.yancomm.net/">Yan</a>) for its curriculum is offered to those with an equivalent CS experience level of a &quot;junior.&quot; In other words, the class expects you to know how to use Linux, understand C,  binary properties ... and much more. If you are already lost, don't despair. I was in the same place as you when I started hacking.  By reading this handbook and investing your time in growing your skillset, you should gain the necessary skills to take this &quot;daunting&quot; junior class.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#the-target-audience" id="the-target-audience">The Target Audience</a></h2>
<p>This handbook is targeted at anyone on or below the &quot;junior in college&quot; level of computer science, though even those individuals may find something useful from this handbook. This handbook is intended to give you all the material and direction you need to start pwn.college. After which, it is assumed you will continue your education with the pwn.college teaching platform. Learning from this handbook will have varying difficulty based on the
reader. The people who will have the most efficient/easiest time learning from this handbook look like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Comp. Sci. College Juniors</li>
<li>Comp. Sci. College Freshmen/Sophomores</li>
<li>High School Students </li>
</ol>
<p>This of course assumes that you are in a college program that touches on systems (which it should). Things like C, debugging, memory management, operating systems. These things will make this experience much easier,
but this handbook was made to help people who have not yet had the chance to take those types of classes (or don't have access to it). There the individuals who will learn/benefit the most from this is:</p>
<ol>
<li>High School Students</li>
<li>Comp. Sci. College Freshmen/Sophomores</li>
<li>Comp. Sci. College Juniors </li>
</ol>
<p>In the end, many people can benefit from this, so feel free to go to exact sections if you think you have nothing to gain from the others; however, I do encourage everyone to at least skim each section since you may
find some surprising tutorial/article I reference. </p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#the-handbooks-novelty" id="the-handbooks-novelty">The Handbook's Novelty</a></h2>
<p>As I briefly mentioned <a href="1_introduction/background.html#the-education-gap">above</a>, there exist many places to start practicing pwning and reversing, but not many that will explain the introductory concepts. As an example, taking a look at the <a href="https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/index.html">Nightmare Book's</a> style of teaching. It is layed out into chapters of exploitation techniques, which I like a lot. Each section is a writeup of how to solve a challenge that has the exploitation technique embedded in it. I think this method is extremely effective for learning for those with pre-established skills in Linux, C, and systems. I think this method fails for noobs who are just learning how C really works (on the memory level). In my brain, <em>prepare for what animations look like in my brain</em>, the learning barriers look like this:</p>
<p><strong>Nightmare Method</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="1_introduction/./nightmare-method.jpeg" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>'Ike Method</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="1_introduction/./ike-method.jpeg" alt="" /></p>
<p>The subtle difference here is that I believe the underlying security concept should be educated and learned about through explicit material first, then it should be reinforced with scripting and systems skills. This is not to say I don't like the Nightmare method, I love it, but others need a different one. This book is that different method. </p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#inspiration" id="inspiration">Inspiration</a></h1>
<p>While writing this, and coming up with the idea, I took a lot of inspiration from blogs and posts as well
as entire pages dedicated to the education of CTF knowledge. A few stick out in my mind:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/index.html">Nightmare Book</a>: theme, idea, use of mdbooks</li>
<li><a href="https://ctf-wiki.org/">CTF Wiki</a>: layout, reversing &amp; pwning content</li>
<li><a href="https://pwn.college/">pwn.college</a>: content</li>
<li><a href="https://picoctf.org/">pico.ctf</a>: educating noobs in CTF</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many others that I did not list here, but I will try to link them in as we get through some
of the content that cites them. </p>

<p>We will cover as few concepts as possible to make you dangerous enough to start down a systems
hacking journey. I will usually use external tutorials embedded in this one to get ideas, 
skills, or setups done quickly. This handbook acts as duct tape for all those tutorials. </p>
<p>As seen in the table of contents on the left, we go through 5 major topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Operating Systems
<ul>
<li>ASU Equiv: CSE330,365. Overviews what makes something an operating system, how we can 
virtualize them, and how we use them in hacking. Includes a set up for containers
and VMs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Programming Languages
<ul>
<li>ASU Equiv: CSE340,240. Overviews what makes something a programming language, then covers
a interpreted and compiled language that are commonly used for hacking. This includes
how to use them efficiently. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Computer Organization 
<ul>
<li>ASU Equiv: CSE230. Overviews the internals of computing and how we organize them, 
including memory layout, assembly (x86), and the types of executable file types
you will find in the wild. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Processes &amp; Debugging
<ul>
<li>ASU Equiv: CSE330,240. Overviews how processes work in Linux and generally. Includes
learning how to trace, debug, and understand running process. Also has a small intro
to using Python to mess with running processes. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Security Concepts
<ul>
<li>ASU Equiv: CSE365. Does a small dive into some common security concepts that will
help new hackers think about problems in different ways. Highly inspired by Adam
Doupe's CSE365.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#how-use-this-handbook" id="how-use-this-handbook">How use this handbook</a></h2>
<p>To efficiently use this handbook you should be prepared to follow various links across the web that
I've curated with time. Most links I use are often for things that are more copy-paste-and-follow like.
As an example, in the next section, I'll have you install a Virtual Machine. In that section I use
an external link to have you install it so I don't duplicate work that is already one well. Other things
like using more complex stuff will usually be covered in the handbook. </p>
<p>Another thing to note is the use of the Dinkus within this text:</p>
<pre><code>* * *
</code></pre>
<p>Whenever you see this symbol it means there is link you will need to follow between the text above 
and below it. That link will take more than 15 minutes to complete. As an example, in the next 
section's introduction I place a link to &quot;What is Linux.&quot; I estimate that you will take around
15 minutes or more of time to read that link before progressing onto the next section. Take your
time with the reading, its the absolute minimum you need to read to get that chapters topic. </p>
<p>Lastly, at the end each section, excluding this one, you can find a practice challenge-set that
will test your knowledge on that chapter. It is highly recommended that you complete all the 
challenges the chapter asks for before you move on to the next chapter. Most of our challenges
currently can be found on <a href="https://dojo.pwn.college/challenges">dojo.pwn.college</a></p>

<h1><a class="header" href="#operating-systems" id="operating-systems">Operating Systems</a></h1>
<p>A speed introduction to operating systems and the fundamentals needed to be a hacker
when working with Linux. If you are already familar with Linux, skip to the last 
sub-section of this chapter: <a href="2_operating_systems/./hacker_practice.html">hacker practice</a> and do the 
shell practice section. </p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#introduction-1" id="introduction-1">Introduction</a></h1>
<h2><a class="header" href="#background-1" id="background-1">Background</a></h2>
<p>To start your journey into binary reversing and exploitation, you first need to understand the platform
on which you reverse and exploit. As you are likely aware, you are currently on an operating system (OS):
likely Windows or MacOS. Generally, people know the difference between these OS, but
to be a good hacker you must understand these differences on a technical level. In future modules,
we will talk about MacOS and Windows, but for now Linux will suffice.</p>
<p>What is Linux you may ask? Linux is the operating system of hackers! It is also the OS
that most embedded devices and servers use. Linux is <a href="https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source">open-source</a>,
which means it is also an OS that is easy to develop on and learn (relative 
to the other ones). Right now it might not be clear what you would be developing that is related
to the OS or how it is useful, but it will hopefully be more clear at the end 
of this section.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#linux" id="linux">Linux</a></h2>
<p>To get a better idea of what Linux is, read the first five sections of this 
<a href="https://www.linux.com/what-is-linux/">article</a>. </p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Now that you know what a distribution of Linux is, you can be informed that we will be using the mainstream, 
Debian based distribution <a href="https://ubuntu.com/tutorials">Ubuntu</a>. If you have found your way here 
through external hacking tutorials, you be tempted to use <a href="https://www.kali.org/downloads/">Kali Linux</a>, a
similarly Debian based distribution. I'll make the argument that it will be easier to use Ubuntu than Kali,
and for the basis of these tutorials, the up-to-date kernel of Ubuntu is better.</p>
<p>TL;DR: We will use Ubuntu, almost none of the tools on Kali are needed for this.</p>
<p>In the next sub-section, we get Ubuntu installed.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#the-kernel" id="the-kernel">The Kernel</a></h2>
<p>Before going straight into using an operating system, it's nice to mention that there is a component of
your computer that makes everything run―it's called the <strong>kernel</strong>. In a typical introduction to 
operating systems you would likely be introduced to this idea in-depth, but I will only briefly 
talk about it. If you are very interested, you should read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Linux-Kernel-Third-Daniel/dp/0596005652">this</a> book after completing this handbook,
as the content assumes you are already a systems hacker.</p>
<p>The kernel is the lowest running software that is always running when the computer is on. It's a fundamental
part of the operating system that runs on your computer. If you imagined the computer as a stack of 
software and hardware, the kernel would be the line that divides the two:</p>
<p><img src="2_operating_systems/./computer_stack.jpeg" alt="picture of computer stack" /></p>
<p>The kernel is responsible for:</p>
<ul>
<li>making sure programs have somewhere to run (talked about later)</li>
<li>hardware peripherals, like you physical mouse, actually do things</li>
<li>your computer having enough memory to function </li>
</ul>
<p>And various other tasks that set your computer apart from your toaster oven. It is often true that each 
operating system will have its own kernel that was designed to work with it.</p>
<p>Since this &quot;program&quot; called the kernel is always running and controls everything important, it's safe to 
assume that this program is at a higher level of existence than a normal program. Not only is it at a 
higher level of <strong>privilege</strong> than a normal program, but it is also at a higher level of privilege than
an admin. The kernel is the god of this computing world, none come before it. </p>
<p>Luckily, this god known as the kernel is benevolent and allows measly normal programs to use parts of
it when needed. Let's take my favorite game <a href="https://minecraft.net">minecraft</a> as an example.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#minecraft-as-an-example" id="minecraft-as-an-example">Minecraft as an example</a></h3>
<p>When you use a normal program, like Minecraft, you are running the program in <strong>user space</strong>. The
user space is the virtual space of your computer where normal programs run. As expected, there 
exists a space for kernel things called the <strong>kernel space</strong>.</p>
<p>So you launch Minecraft, and load into your favorite world. You are in the user space. But now,
you move your mouse so that your view in Minecraft rotates -- you have now briefly entered 
kernel space. Why? Because hardware caused something called an <code>interrupt</code>, which in the 
god analogy is equivalent to praying to god for god for a brief blessing of power.</p>
<p>When you move your mouse this is what happens:</p>
<ol>
<li>The software that drives the mouse detects a movement</li>
<li>The software causes an interrupt, which stops whatever else is running for a brief time</li>
<li>It enters kernel mode by setting a value that signifies that it is &quot;privileged&quot;</li>
<li>The kernel interprets the exact movement then sends the info back to user space </li>
<li>The mouse move is handled in Minecraft. </li>
</ol>
<p>You can visualize it like this (prepare for 3rd grade drawings):</p>
<p><img src="2_operating_systems/./minecraft.jpeg" alt="" /></p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#tldr" id="tldr">TL;DR</a></h3>
<p>The gist here is that there is a <strong>super privileged</strong> software running on every computer called
the kernel. The kernel controls everything at the lowest level, and compromising it means you
compromised everything above it―any software running on the computer. In our next section
on virtualization, it's helpful to know this thing called the kernel exists. </p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#virtualization" id="virtualization">Virtualization</a></h1>
<p>Virtualization is the cornerstone of modern operating systems. To virtualize something is 
to create a virtual version of it that does not require hardware. As an example, it's like
running an Android phone on your laptop. The android operating system is supposed to only
be run on phone hardware (for the most part), but yet we can run it on a laptop with 
an <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator">emulator</a>. </p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#virtual-machines" id="virtual-machines">Virtual Machines</a></h1>
<h2><a class="header" href="#what-is-a-virtual-machine" id="what-is-a-virtual-machine">What is a Virtual Machine?</a></h2>
<p>A virtual machine (VM) is a virtualized operating system. Read this 
<a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/virtualization/what-is-a-virtual-machine">article</a> before
continuing. If you are very lazy, you can just watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIVXjl4SwVo">video</a></p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>We use VMs, as said in the article, because it is isolated from the host system and 
it allows us to keep our nice comfortable OS on our computer. This means you will
have both your host OS (Windows/MacOS), and this VM of Linux for hacking.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#setting-up-a-vm" id="setting-up-a-vm">Setting up a VM</a></h2>
<p>If you are an ASU student, use VMWare. The school has given access
to it for free. Get it <a href="https://ets.engineering.asu.edu/vmware/">here</a>.
If you are not, <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">Virtualbox</a> works as well.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Now that you have download the software to use a VM, let's actually make an Ubuntu VM.
Follow the tutorial below for the software you are using:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://linuxhint.com/install_ubuntu_vmware_workstation/">VMWare Tutorial</a></li>
<li><a href="https://itsfoss.com/install-linux-in-virtualbox/">Virtual Box Tutorial</a></li>
</ul>
<p>After following the tutorials above, you should have an Ubuntu machine ready to go with a
login.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#containers" id="containers">Containers</a></h1>
<p>Containers are another level of virtualization that allows for isolated spaces in the kernel
to be created and destroyed without affecting each other. </p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#what-is-a-container" id="what-is-a-container">What is a container?</a></h2>
<p>To get more specific, read what Docker has to say on what a Container is: <a href="https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container">here</a>.
Now you may be wondering, how does this differ from a VM? As an end-user, there is no difference. But as 
far as technicals go, Microsoft's diagram is a good comparison:</p>
<p><strong>VMs vs Containers</strong>
<img src="2_operating_systems/./ms_container_v_vm.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>In simple terms, a VM is much more heavy since we need to initialize an entirely new kernel for each VM we make.
In a container, we share the already existent kernel and, using some technical tricks, create isolated sections
of the kernel that we then use to create containers (which act as VMs). </p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: container light, VM heavy.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#why-use-a-container" id="why-use-a-container">Why use a container?</a></h3>
<p>You may be asking yourself, &quot;why use a container?&quot; We already are in a VM, so as far as affecting our host machine goes, we are
already in the clear. Containers become the most useful when trying to run applications that have dependencies that
we might not have access to in our current version of the VM. For instance, wanting to run an <code>Ubuntu 18.04</code> application
while in <code>Ubuntu 20.04</code>. You can either pray to the computer gods and hope your dependences still work in the new version,
or you can use a docker container that creates an <code>Ubuntu 18.04</code> environment in it to run. The latter is easier. In addition,
containers are not persistent, meaning that when you are done running the container, everything you created inside of it is
destroyed. </p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#docker-the-modern-container" id="docker-the-modern-container">Docker: the modern container</a></h2>
<p>Now that you know what a container is, it's time we set you up to be able to use containers. There are many implementations
of containers, but the one we will use is <a href="https://www.docker.com/why-docker">Docker</a>. Docker is very mainstream and 
has a lot of use across the computer science industry. Take for instance <a href="https://wordpress.com/">Wordpress</a>, which you
have likely heard of or used. It's a platform for building websites for free with a GUI. It also has a lot of 
dependencies and things you need to set up before using it. Wordpress uses Docker, and has made a docker container
that does it all for you. Check it out: <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/wordpress">here</a>. Essentially you can run an entire
wordpress hosting software with a database all with this simple command in a terminal:</p>
<pre><code class="language-docker">docker run wordpress
</code></pre>
<p>Which is a great segway into installing Docker, since it requires use of the <code>command line</code>.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#setting-up-docker" id="setting-up-docker">Setting up docker</a></h2>
<p>We will now install <code>Docker</code> on your <code>Ubuntu VM</code>, so from now on all instructions are pertaining to being inside
you VM. First login to the VM, then open up the terminal. You can do this by either searching applications or 
simple right-clicking the desktop and clicking <code>&quot;Open terminal&quot;</code>. This is where the fun begins. Pro-tip,
you can click the copy button in the top left of the code snippets to copy and paste to your terminal.</p>
<p>It's alright if you don't understand all the commands in this section, we will cover using the terminal later.</p>
<p>First, we need to update the list of installable applications. Run:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo apt-get update
</code></pre>
<p>After that, we need to install the dependencies of docker:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo apt-get install \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg-agent \
    software-properties-common
</code></pre>
<p>Next, let's add dockers GPG key so we can get their software:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
</code></pre>
<p>Add the repository:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo add-apt-repository \
   &quot;deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
   $(lsb_release -cs) \
   stable&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, update once more and install:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo apt-get update
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
</code></pre>
<p>Congratulations, you just installed your first command line tool! And quite a powerful one.
Let's verify it works.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#using-docker" id="using-docker">Using docker</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#verification" id="verification">Verification</a></h3>
<p>To verify you actualy have docker running, simply run:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo docker run hello-world
</code></pre>
<p>The output should look something like:</p>
<pre><code>Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the &quot;hello-world&quot; image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker ID:

<h3><a class="header" href="#having-some-fun" id="having-some-fun">Having some fun</a></h3>
<p>To make things a little more interesting, let's launch an older Ubuntu version <strong>inside</strong> your
current Ubuntu version. Virtualception. Let's first see what version we are on in our machine:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">grep '^VERSION' /etc/os-release
</code></pre>
<p>I'm on <code>Ubuntu 18.04</code>, so my command output this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">VERSION=&quot;18.04.5 LTS (Bionic Beaver)&quot;
VERSION_ID=&quot;18.04&quot;
VERSION_CODENAME=bionic
</code></pre>
<p>You may be on <code>20.04</code> so it will look slightly different. Take a note of the version you are on. </p>
<p>Now let's start an <code>Ubuntu 16.04</code> machine. Run:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">docker run -it ubuntu:16.04
</code></pre>
<p>Since it's the first run it will take a few minutes for it to pull down the Ubuntu image data. 
Once it's done, you should see a waiting prompt that looks like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">root@cadd99990677:/#
</code></pre>
<p>You have now opened a terminal in a virtual Ubuntu. Congratz. Run the same command from earlier in this prompt:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">grep '^VERSION' /etc/os-release
</code></pre>
<p>The output should be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">VERSION=&quot;16.04.7 LTS (Xenial Xerus)&quot;
VERSION_ID=&quot;16.04&quot;
VERSION_CODENAME=xenial
</code></pre>
<p>Pretty cool right? We are inside a virtual machine in a virtual machine (technically a container, but you get the point).
Now type:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">exit
</code></pre>
<p>and hit enter. You will be back to your normal terminal. Amazing! </p>
<p>We will use Docker often. If you are excited about this, you can check out this tutorial: <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-started/02_our_app/">here</a>,
though it is not mandatory. Now it's time to learn how to use <code>Bash</code>, the terminal you typed on earlier. </p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#linux-os" id="linux-os">Linux OS</a></h1>
<p>Instead of explaining how the Linux Operating System works from the ground up, we will
instead attempt to learn how to use it as quickly as possible. To do this, we will cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using the terminal</li>
<li>Permissions and how they work</li>
<li>SSHing</li>
<li>Puzzle solving in the shell</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="header" href="#the-terminal" id="the-terminal">The Terminal</a></h1>
<p>You got a little taste of using the terminal in the last section, but now it's time we
got literate. Expect this section to take a few hours since we will be out-sourcing
work to a few different problems/tutorials across the web. </p>
<p>For the majority of getting you good with begging parts of Linux, we will be using
the amazing class <a href="https://missing.csail.mit.edu/">The Missing Semester</a> by MIT. 
We will not be doing the entire class, only the parts that matter the most.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#the-shell" id="the-shell">The Shell</a></h2>
<p>You can think of the shell as the terminal you used earlier. The shell is your
text interface into the computer. It allows you to do things quickly and powerfully.
To become a good hacker, you must first learn how to navigate and use a shell. </p>
<p>To do this, we will now jump to the earlier mentioned MIT course on hacking
tools. Read <strong>and do the exercises</strong> of this lesson: <a href="https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/course-shell/#topic-1-the-shell">Topic 1: The Shell</a>.
If you do not like reading, you can also find the lecture at the top of that page. 
This will take some time, so come back here when you are done. </p>
<p><em>take the time to do the exercises before moving on, it will help</em></p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#shell-scripting" id="shell-scripting">Shell Scripting</a></h2>
<p>At this point, it should start becoming clearer that each shell has it's own
scripting language that makes automation very easy. Hacking often involves
repetitive tasks and doing things on a massive level from a shell. Let's
learn how to use <em>scripting</em> (using the language) in a powerful way.</p>
<p>Like last time, Read <strong>and do the exercises</strong> of this lesson: <a href="https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/shell-tools/">Topic 2: Shell Tools</a>
This will take some time, so come back here when you are done. </p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#using-vim" id="using-vim">Using VIM</a></h2>
<p>Often, after scripting and finding your way to files in your filesystem you
need to edit them. Currently, you should have no idea how to edit files in your terminal, but we
are going to change that now. Hackers need to work fast, and that means writing code directly
from the same interface you use to run it. The terminal is this place. To edit things
fast, we use a quaint program called <a href="https://www.vim.org/">VIM</a> -- it looks old and feels old,
but it is very powerful. </p>
<p>Like earlier, Read <strong>and do the exercises</strong> of this lesson: <a href="https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/editors/">Topic 3: Editors</a>
This will take some time, so come back here when you are done. </p>
<p>After this, you will be quite a powerful user. </p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#permissions" id="permissions">Permissions</a></h1>
<p>The permission to do something is a major component of hacking. Often, we are trying to escelate
our privligae in whatever scenario that is. This can mean becoming the admin of a computer you don't own, 
or simply being able to access restricted things in a video game. Following in this nature, files
in the Linux operating system have permissions.</p>
<p>To learn how they work, read <a href="https://linuxcommand.org/lc3_lts0090.php">this</a>. It should be easier 
and faster than the earlier sections, considering you may have already encountered permissions in
your own system. </p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#hacker-practice" id="hacker-practice">Hacker Practice</a></h1>
<p>To practice, we are going to be using a hacking practice site called a Wargame site. These sites
are similar to a CTF in that they offer challenging puzzles that require technical knowledge. 
They are different in the fact that they have no time limit to the competition. People from across
the world can use the challenges on the site at any time.</p>
<p>The site we are using is called Over The Wire. </p>
<p>The wargame Over The Wire has a lot of different modules that you can practice on, but for the sake
of speed in getting up to hacking whitebelt in a reasonable time, we will only be doing the
<a href="https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/">bandit</a> challenges. Before you start, let's talk about how you will play them.
If you already know how to use SSH, skip to the <a href="2_operating_systems/hacker_practice.html#practice">practice</a>.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#ssh" id="ssh">SSH</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_(Secure_Shell)">SSH</a> stands for Secure Shell. It's a protocol 
(messaging language) used to get a remote shell on another machine. A remote shell is what it sounds 
like: an interactive shell you can use on a machine you don't have physical access too. After using it a 
few times it becomes clearer what this means. </p>
<p>Recall the Ubuntu container we used in the <a href="2_operating_systems/./containers.html">containers</a> section. We ran our 
docker command and it gave us a shell into a different Ubuntu version.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">docker run -it ubuntu:16.04
</code></pre>
<p>It resulted in a shell. And to get out of the shell, and subsequently the container, we used:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">exit
</code></pre>
<p>In the shell we had, which returned us to our machine. SSHing is very similar. Let's SSH into
the first level of bandit, which is <a href="https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit0.html">here</a>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
</code></pre>
<p>Input the password, <code>bandit0</code>, and now we are in a shell: </p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">bandit0@bandit:~$
</code></pre>
<p>As you guessed it, this is likely a different version of Ubuntu then what you are running. Use our 
earlier command from the containers section to check what that is. To confirm that this is<br />
a machine we don't own, let's check what the ip address is. An ip address is an address that is 
associated with a device on the internet. Ideally, this is a unique address that no other device
should share, but nowadays this is not always true. For now, assume it is unique. </p>
<p>Run:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">curl https://ipinfo.io/ip
</code></pre>
<p>Take a note of the address, then <code>exit</code> the machine just like before:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">exit
</code></pre>
<p>Now we are back on our host machine. Run the same <code>curl</code> command again to get the ip address of 
your machine:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">curl https://ipinfo.io/ip
</code></pre>
<p>Notice the numbers are fairly different? This confirms that the machine is at least not local 
(on our current network). If you want to take it further, you can even look up the location 
associated with the ip address of <code>Over The Wire</code>. </p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#ssh-semantics" id="ssh-semantics">SSH Semantics</a></h3>
<p>Lastly, let's talk about the semantics of the actual <code>SSH</code> command we ran:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
</code></pre>
<p>Like logging into any machine, it requires a username. The first part of the ssh command is
the username, which is <code>bandit</code> in this case. Next is the <code>@</code> symbol to signify where the end
of the username is and where the remote address begins. The address here is
<code>bandit.labs.overthewire.org</code>. You may be confused here because it does not look like a normal
ip address, which is just numbers. This is due to <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/">DNS</a>.
DNS is outside the scope of this section, but just know it allows you to have fancy names point 
to normal looking ip addresses. </p>
<p>So far we have learned SSH looks like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">ssh &lt;username&gt;@&lt;ip_address&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The last thing we have to talk about is the <code>-p 2220</code> in the command. This is an option that specifies 
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_(computer_networking)">port</a> to connect over. You can learn more 
about all the options of <code>ssh</code> by running:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">man ssh

<h1><a class="header" href="#computer-organization" id="computer-organization">Computer Organization</a></h1>
<p>In the last chapter, you learned how to use other people's programs (<code>ls</code>, <code>sh</code>, <code>find</code>), virtualize things, and how the operating system
interacts with programs. In this chapter, we learn how to write our own programs, interface directly with the kernel, and understand how the computer manages high-level ideas for our low-level solutions. </p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#introduction-2" id="introduction-2">Introduction</a></h1>
<p>To cover computer organization is to cover what it means to <em>be a computer</em>. The way we organize the hardware dictates how our computer works. The organization of hardware in a particular form is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_architecture">computer architecture</a>.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#the-von-neumann-architecture" id="the-von-neumann-architecture">The Von Neumann Architecture</a></h2>
<p>The von Neumann architecture is by far the most famous and well-known abstract computer architecture in computer science. It's principal belief is that our computer is a &quot;pyramid&quot; of memory units that get faster but smaller as we go up the stack. You put things you need faster in the higher level memories, and things you need slower and in larger quantities in the lower level memories: </p>
<p><img src="3_computer_organization/./mem_model_1.jpeg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Abstractly, this is done because faster memory units are more expensive to make, and usually, we don't need faster memory for long. So what the hell is a faster memory unit? Let's revise the picture above:</p>
<p><img src="3_computer_organization/./mem_model_2.jpeg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Two commonly known memory units is your hard drive and your RAM. As you likely know, the RAM is much smaller than your hard drive, but somehow much more expensive. In a parallel fashion, your RAM is also much faster than your hard drive. From now on, let's refer to your RAM as <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/m/memory.htm">computer memory</a>. You probably have 8 Gigabytes of memory. Why is it so small? What is your computer memory actually used for? Why does it exist aside from your hard drive? The Von Neumann architecture dictates that it exists to put things we need more frequently or faster in. The special thing about your computer memory, though, is that it is volatile—meaning anything put in it is deleted when your computer restarts. </p>
<p>Often the things we need in memory are programs, because we want those to run as fast as possible. Before we talk about putting programs in memory, we need to briefly talk about how we count in computers (yes, strange idea). Move on to the next reading.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#math--counting" id="math--counting">Math &amp; Counting</a></h1>
<h2><a class="header" href="#bits" id="bits">Bits</a></h2>
<p>You've seen it before in movies, a series of ones and zeros. Now you have a name to go with it: Bits! Here is an example of some Bits:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">0100010101001001011101001001001000000000011101101111010111010110
</code></pre>
<p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The bit is a basic unit of information in computing and digital communications ... The bit represents a logical state with one of two possible values. These values are most commonly represented as either &quot;1&quot; or &quot;0&quot;, but other representations such as true/false, yes/no, +/−, or on/off are common.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's take emphasis to the &quot;represents a logical state with one of two possible values.&quot; So a bit <code>b</code>, can be either a <code>1</code> or a <code>0</code>. That means a single bit has two combinations (1 or 0). Let's make this a little more abstract: a single bit can represent two distinct things.</p>
<p>As an example, let's say we own a light tower at a dock. If the light is on, aka <code>1</code>, then a boat can dock now. If the light is off, aka <code>0</code>, then the boat can't dock now. Simple, on or off. <code>1 = dock</code>; <code>0 = no dock</code>. But what if we need to tell the people in the boats more than just two things? Well, we can get more lights (aka more bits). If we have two bits, we now have <code>2 * 2 = 4</code> possible combinations, so we can represent 4 things in total now.</p>
<p>Assume the boaters know which light is on the left and which is on the right. Now we can signal four different states of docking:</p>
<pre><code>00 = can't dock now
01 = can dock in 1 hour
10 = can dock in 2 hours
11 = can dock now 
</code></pre>
<p>So if the left light is on, but the right is not, then you can dock in 2 hours. In this way, we just <a href="https://techterms.com/definition/encoding">encoded</a> 4 different states of being. Pretty cool right? How in only two series of 1's and 0's we got that much information out. So how does it scale? </p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#scaling-bits" id="scaling-bits">Scaling Bits</a></h3>
<p>If 1 bit can encode <code>2 data states</code>. 2 bits can encode <code>4 data states</code>. 3 bits can encode <code>2 * 2 * 2 = 8 data states</code>. The pattern here is called the power of twos. To get the number of states your bits can represent is simple: raise 2 to the power of the number of states you have. Here is a fancy function for it:</p>
<pre><code>states(b) = 2 ^ b
</code></pre>
<p>Where <code>b</code> is the number of bits you have. So if you have <code>8 bits</code>, then you have <code>2 ^ 8 = 256</code> different states you can represent... Yeah, that scales very fast. If you just had 8 flash lights, you could represent 256 different things to your friend across the street. Pretty cool. You may have noticed already, but its an exponential ramp-up on the number of states you can represent, which is good for us computer scientist.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#bits--bytes" id="bits--bytes">Bits &amp; Bytes</a></h2>
<p>Often, we need to use more than just a single bit. We call a set of 8 bits a <strong>byte</strong>. Using our earlier maths, a single byte can represent 256 different states. When we use bits to store human data, we usually need much more than 1 byte. This is where our SI table comes for bytes:</p>
<pre><code>1 kilobyte (kb) = 1024 bytes = 8192 bits
1 megabyte (mb) = 1024 kb 
1 gigabyte (gb) = 1024 mb
1 terabyte (tb) = 1024 gb
</code></pre>
<p>You probably have more or equal to 256 GB of disk storage right? That means your disk has <code>2147483648</code> bits ready to hold either a <code>1</code> or <code>0</code> in it's place. That also means that your hard disk can represent <code>2 ^ 2147483648</code> different states. That's insane. How they do that with hardware is out of the scope of this handbook, but know that they do it with a little electrical engineering magic.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#hexadecimal" id="hexadecimal">Hexadecimal</a></h2>
<p>We talk about bytes so much that it is often easier to refer to a binary number in a completely new counting system called <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal">hexadecimal</a> because it is more concise. Hexadecimal is one type of number system. Decimal, the one we usually count in, is another. To understand these <code>bases</code> and how to look at hex, watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EJay-6Bioo">khan academy video</a></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>As a recap, Hex is converted to decimal and binary like so:</p>
<pre><code>0 = 0 (10) = 0000
1 = 1 (10) = 0001
2 = 2 (10) = 0010
3 = 3 (10) = 0011
4 = 4 (10) = 0100
5 = 5 (10) = 0101
6 = 6 (10) = 0110
7 = 7 (10) = 0111
8 = 8 (10) = 1000
9 = 9 (10) = 1001
A = 10 (10) = 1010
B = 11 (10) = 1001
C = 12 (10) = 1100
D = 13 (10) = 1101
E = 14 (10) = 1110
F = 15 (10) = 1111
</code></pre>
<p>To make it clear that we are writing in hex, and not decimal, we will always append a <code>0x</code> to the beginning of the number. So when we say <code>0x0F</code>, you know we mean <code>15</code> in decimal. </p>
<p>To tie this all together, we go back to how many bits are in a byte. There are 8 bits in a byte which we usually write like so <code>0000 0000</code>. We write it like that because the hex representation is <code>0x00</code>. Now we can refer to bigger bit numbers really easy. For instance, if we wanted to refer to <code>20</code> decimal we would just write <code>0x14</code>, which is <code>0001 0100</code> in binary. If you were confused about that conversion, re-watch the video above. </p>
<p>Remember that hex bytes can also scale just like we did earlier with bits. We can represent <strong>huge</strong> numbers with hex that we would not normally talk about, like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">0x7ffff7dd409
</code></pre>
<p>Which represents the number <code>140737351860368</code> in decimal. Yup that value took 6 bytes to represent. Aka <code>6*8</code> bits.</p>
<p>Now that we understand the fundamentals of bits, lets move on to using them in logic.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#bits--logic" id="bits--logic">Bits &amp; Logic</a></h1>
<p>Continuing our discussion on bits, let's talk more about how we can mess with the states system we described earlier. Before that, lets clarify some notation:</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#logic" id="logic">Logic</a></h2>
<p>You've definitely heard the term often, but how deeply have you understood the fundamentals of it? You can find an elongated definition on Wikipedia for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_logic">Mathematical Logic</a>, but lets define it simply as conclusions and reasoning of truths.</p>
<hr />
<h3><a class="header" href="#notation" id="notation">Notation</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><code> x = y</code> means y is assigned to x, or, x is now what y is.</li>
<li><code>x == y</code> is a statement about equivalence &quot;x is the same as y&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>The second thing is a question of whether x is the same as y or not. As an example, say <code>x = 7; y = 3</code>. If we now say:</p>
<pre><code>x == y
</code></pre>
<p>The answer to the question would be <code>False</code>. We could also write it as:</p>
<pre><code>(x == y) -&gt; False
</code></pre>
<p>This could also be said as <code>x == y</code> implies <code>False</code>. </p>
<hr />
<p>To make logic easy to write in concise ways, we define abstract things as variables. Something like:</p>
<ul>
<li>S: &quot;Today it's sunny&quot;</li>
<li>R: &quot;Toady it's rainy&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Now just having truths assigned to variables would make logic very useless, so they only become useful when we apply <strong>operations</strong> to them. These operations are called <strong>logic operations</strong>. There are 4 fundamental logic operators:</p>
<ul>
<li>AND</li>
<li>OR</li>
<li>NOT</li>
<li>XOR</li>
</ul>
<p>Let't talk about each one.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#and" id="and">AND</a></h3>
<p><code>AND</code> works logically like how you use it in english. Its useful for understanding the truth of two things. As an example:</p>
<pre><code>S: &quot;Today it's sunny&quot;
R: &quot;Today it's rainy&quot;

S = True
R = False

(S AND R) -&gt; False
</code></pre>
<p>Let's decode the above. First, we defined S and R as shorthand notation for an abstract thing like the state of the day (being rainy or sunny). Next we described the truth of the states we defined. &quot;Today it's sunny&quot; is True; then we said &quot;Today it's rainy&quot; is False. Lastly, we evaluated the truth value of:</p>
<p><code>(S AND R)</code></p>
<p>or the statement:</p>
<p><code>Today it is sunny AND it is rainy</code>, which is <code>False</code>.</p>
<p>It's False because we had earlier said that it was not rainy today. In this way, you can treat <code>AND</code> like a function that takes two arguments <code>AND(x, y)</code>. The input is two truth variables (which could be true or false), and the output is <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>. Let's shorten the state <code>True</code> to T and <code>False</code> to F. With all your knowledge we can easily define all the possible outputs of <code>AND</code>, known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_table">truth table</a>.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>X</th><th>Y</th><th>X AND Y</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>F</td><td>F</td><td>F</td></tr>
<tr><td>T</td><td>F</td><td>F</td></tr>
<tr><td>T</td><td>T</td><td>T</td></tr>
<tr><td>F</td><td>T</td><td>F</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>As you can see, the output is only ever True if both X and Y are true. After all of this, it will be much easier to define the other operators.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#or" id="or">OR</a></h3>
<p><code>OR</code> is very similar to <code>AND</code>. It takes two truth values and outputs <code>True</code> if just one of the two are <code>True</code>. Here is the truth table:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>X</th><th>Y</th><th>X OR Y</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>F</td><td>F</td><td>F</td></tr>
<tr><td>T</td><td>F</td><td>T</td></tr>
<tr><td>T</td><td>T</td><td>T</td></tr>
<tr><td>F</td><td>T</td><td>T</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<h3><a class="header" href="#not" id="not">NOT</a></h3>
<p><code>NOT</code> is special because it only takes a single truth value. All <code>NOT</code> does is reverse the truth of its argument. Here is the truth value:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>X</th><th>NOT X</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>F</td><td>T</td></tr>
<tr><td>T</td><td>F</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Its useful now though to say that you can compound logical operators:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>X</th><th>Y</th><th>X OR Y</th><th>NOT( X OR Y )</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>F</td><td>F</td><td>F</td><td>T</td></tr>
<tr><td>T</td><td>F</td><td>T</td><td>F</td></tr>
<tr><td>T</td><td>T</td><td>T</td><td>F</td></tr>
<tr><td>F</td><td>T</td><td>T</td><td>F</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>In addition to that, NOT also has a special reversing mechanic on <code>AND</code> and <code>OR</code>. For instance:</p>
<pre><code>(NOT(X OR Y)) == (NOT(X) AND NOT(Y))
</code></pre>
<p>You can test that above by making your own truth table. Notice how you can distribute the <code>NOT</code> to each variable and the operator, which flipped it to <code>AND</code>. The same is true in the reverse. </p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#xor" id="xor">XOR</a></h3>
<p><code>XOR</code> takes two truth values like the others, but is less used in normal english. Its short for <code>Exclusive</code>, which means the output is only true when the inputs differ:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>X</th><th>Y</th><th>X XOR Y</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>F</td><td>F</td><td>F</td></tr>
<tr><td>T</td><td>F</td><td>T</td></tr>
<tr><td>T</td><td>T</td><td>F</td></tr>
<tr><td>F</td><td>T</td><td>T</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Notice how it is only True when things going in are different from each other? Its an interesting mechanic and will be used more later. </p>
<p>Now that we have a high level understand of logic, we can now relate it </p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#bit-logic" id="bit-logic">Bit Logic</a></h2>
<p>Logic with bits work exactly the same as logic in general. <code>True</code> is <code>1</code>; <code>False</code> is <code>0</code>. </p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#notation-1" id="notation-1">Notation</a></h3>
<p>Here is our new notation that is generally for bit logic:</p>
<pre><code>AND: &amp;
OR: |
NOT: !
XOR: ^
</code></pre>
<p>All of them still work the same, but now if I want to say <code>x AND y</code> I would actually say <code>x &amp; y</code>.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#multi-bit-logic-operations" id="multi-bit-logic-operations">Multi-Bit Logic Operations</a></h3>
<p>Operations on variables with bits work even on the <strong>byte</strong> level:</p>
<pre><code>x = 11110101    
y = 00101101

(x &amp; y) == 00100101
</code></pre>
<p>How did the above work? If you look closely, each logic operation was applied on each individual bit it lined up with. </p>
<p>Now, recall that bits can also be represented as hex! This means we can do logic operations on things that <em>look</em> like numbers (but remember they are bits under the hood):</p>
<pre><code>x = 0x13 (00010011) 
y = 0x32 (00110010)

(x &amp; y) == 0x33 (00110011)
</code></pre>
<p>This entire time we have been using <strong>bytes</strong>, but to keep with the earlier theme, why don't we assume that we can represent things in 64bits. For conciseness, we don't write leading 0's in a hex number:</p>
<pre><code>x = 0xcafe (64 bits)
y = 0xbabe (64 bits)

(x ^ y) == 0x0000000000007040
</code></pre>
<p>The zeros are shown in the result just to clarify once again that we are in 64bits, but all the operations we have done before still work. Remember you can always compound logic statements on other logic statements (and store them in another variable if you).</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#logic-gates" id="logic-gates">Logic Gates</a></h3>
<p>All these bit operations are actually mechanics of real-world hardware that things run on. Since electricity is like a 1 or a 0, it makes sense that these logic gates are what we first implemented in hardware.</p>
<p>Circuit Engineers annotate these gates like shown <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_gate#Symbols">here</a>. Generally speaking, all things on computers first start with these fundamental logic gates that are implemented in hardware. </p>
<p>Now that we understand how to truly utilize the power of bits and logic, we can move on to understand a computer at its lowest level. </p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#memory" id="memory">Memory</a></h1>
<p>Returning back from our discussion on <a href="3_computer_organization/./math_and_counting.html">counting</a>, let's talk about RAM, which we now refer to as computer memory. We will first talk about how the Von Neumann architecture affects how we run programs; then, we will talk about how bits dictate just how large programs can be. </p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#programs-in-memory" id="programs-in-memory">Programs in Memory</a></h1>
<h2><a class="header" href="#things-exist-in-memory" id="things-exist-in-memory">Things Exist in Memory</a></h2>
<p>Recall our earlier discussion on the Von Neumann architecture. We want things that we need faster to be used in the RAM since it is faster than the disk. </p>
<p>The things we usually need faster than anything else are our running <strong>programs</strong>. In addition, we don't need the space taken up by the running program to exist for a <em>long time</em>. Once we close our program, we want the running code that runs that program to be destroyed. To clarify, we don't want the data that the program creates destroyed, but the actual code that runs the program for that instance of it running. That's a lot of circular logic. Let's explain it out for our favorite game Minecraft.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#minecraft-as-something-living-in-memory" id="minecraft-as-something-living-in-memory">Minecraft as something living in Memory</a></h3>
<p>Let's say you wanted to start up Minecraft, open your favorite world you have been working on for three months, and place a single block from your inventory, then save and quit. Here's what happens:</p>
<ol>
<li>You double click the Minecraft icon</li>
<li>Immediately, the OS places a copy of Minecraft's Code into RAM</li>
<li>The OS (CPU) starts <strong>executing</strong> the location of memory Minecraft specified to start with</li>
</ol>
<p>Now Minecraft is running and you can interact with it. When you click buttons in the Minecraft game, it simply transitions to different locations in memory where those button's code exists. Now you open your world:</p>
<ol>
<li>You click &quot;open world&quot; and you select your awesome world. </li>
<li>Immediately, Minecraft finds the world on your <em>hard drive</em> where it has been saved for months</li>
<li>Minecraft copies all the files that make it a world and places it in RAM</li>
</ol>
<p>Now you are playing Minecraft in your favorite world! When you place a block down, that block is placed in the &quot;copied&quot; world that is currently in RAM. That's right, all of the changes you make before saving are in RAM; that's why games always tell you &quot;don't turn off while saving...&quot; because your RAM contents are essentially deleted when your system turns off. </p>
<p>So you place the block and save &amp; quit. Then close Minecraft. </p>
<ol>
<li>Your computer copies the content of the world in RAM and re-saves it over the world on your hard drive</li>
<li>Minecraft deletes the world copied into RAM</li>
<li>Minecraft sends a signal to the OS that it is done running</li>
<li>The OS gets that signal and destroyed the Minecraft copied into RAM. </li>
</ol>
<p>Here is a diagram to summarize everything that happened:</p>
<p><img src="3_computer_organization/./mc_in_ram.jpeg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Notice how this whole time we were playing on code that was copied into RAM. The entire time, the real Minecraft was sitting comfortably on your hard drive while a copy of it was doing all the world. As with everything you make changes to on your computer, copies are first placed into memory and then saved back to the hard drive after editing. </p>
<p>As you can see, we care about the response time of Minecraft so we copy it into memory. As with all things we need fast, they go in memory.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#observing-things-taking-memory" id="observing-things-taking-memory">Observing things taking Memory</a></h2>
<p>Open up the fancy terminal again and install <code>htop</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo apt-get install htop
</code></pre>
<p><code>htop</code> is an upgraded version of <code>top</code>. It allows you to see what is running on your computer and how much &quot;things&quot; it is using. One of those things is memory. Run <code>htop</code> by typing the command <code>htop</code> in the terminal. You should see a big thing pop open, with what looks like a sound bar thing on the top of the screen. One of them is labeled <code>Mem</code> for Memory. It is of course your RAM usage. Right now, with nothing but a terminal open, you should be seeing no more than 1 Gig of memory being used. </p>
<p>For me it looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="3_computer_organization/./memory_in_use.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Now go to your Ubuntu desktop and open <code>Firefox</code>. You should notice maybe half a gig of memory now being taken up. If you open more tabs and websites, then more RAM will be taken. This is memory in use! </p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#summary" id="summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p>Things exist in memory. When you run a program, it is put in memory. When you edit a file it is put in memory. When you run your Virtual Machine, it is put in memory. </p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#addressing" id="addressing">Addressing</a></h1>
<p>In the last section about <a href="3_computer_organization/./programs_in_mem.html">programs in memory</a> we talked about loading Minecraft into memory (RAM). It was briefly mentioned that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you click buttons in the Minecraft game, it simply transitions to different locations in memory where those button's code exists.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The way it transitions to different locations in memory is through addressing. Like real life, addressing helps us find the places things live, in-memory for this case. In real life, someone would give you a unique string, their address, where you could find them in real life. Something like <code>411 North Central Ave, Phoenix, AZ</code>. In memory, we follow these same rules, but to a more simplified manner. </p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#linear-addresses" id="linear-addresses">Linear Addresses</a></h2>
<p>The simplified manner is that memory has a very specific set of rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>Each address is unique</li>
<li>Each address is a number</li>
</ol>
<p>The number starts at zero and continues to whatever the <code>bit</code> count of the computer is. This fact should now help you realize what it means to have a <code>64bit</code> computer vs a <code>32bit</code> computer. In the old days, everything was <code>32bit</code>, but now everything is <code>64bit</code>. If you find some old applications, you may notice the option to download either—since programs made in 32bit are cross-compatible for 64bit. </p>
<p>Anyway, we will assume you are on a 64bit computer. That means the starting address, or the smallest address, is <code>0x0000000000000000</code> and the largest address is <code>0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF</code>. You will notice this is an 8 byte range (also 64bit). Here is how you can visualize the memory in your computer:</p>

<p>At each address is an 8 byte slot for data. This means we could store 8 bytes nearly 2**(64) times. That is wayyyyyyyyy more RAM than you have in your computer, but it is nice to know that our current architecture could support even a huge amount of RAM. </p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#reading--writing-data" id="reading--writing-data">Reading &amp; Writing Data</a></h2>

<p>You can consider that when Minecraft launches the OS know where the beginning and end of Minecraft is. It records it with <strong>labels</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>minecraft_start = 0x0000000040000000
minecraft_end = 0x0000000050000000
</code></pre>
<p>Minecraft will of course take up a large portion of space:</p>
<pre><code>*----*----*----*----* 0x0000000000000000
|                   |
|                   |
|                   |
|-------------------| 0x0000000040000000

|     MINECRAFT     |
|                   |

|                   |
*----*----*----*----* 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that Minecraft neither starts at the beginning nor at the end of memory. Any program can be loaded at any random place in memory. In addition, other magical things happen to actually allow you to break up a program into multiple places, called <a href="https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/virtual-address">Virtual Addressing</a>. For now, consider things to be linear and continous.</p>
<p>The OS does not know the exact location of the Minecraft Quit Button code. Instead, it only knows an <strong>offset</strong> from <code>minecraft_start</code>. Something like:</p>
<pre><code>mc_quit_btn_offset = 0x80
</code></pre>
<p>Note: assume there are the correct amount of 0's on the other side of values when they are small like <code>0x80</code>. This is all still 64bits</p>
<p>Now to run the Minecraft Quit Button, the OS simply reads the offset, then executes it. </p>
<pre><code class="language-python">code = read(minecraft_start + mc_quit_btn_offset)
execute(code)
</code></pre>
<pre><code>*----*----*----*----* 0x0000000000000000
|                   |
|                   |
|                   |
|-------------------| 0x0000000040000000
|                   | &lt;--------- mc_quit_btn_offset
|                   |
|     MINECRAFT     |

|                   |
*----*----*----*----* 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
</code></pre>
<p>Other things happen, but for now understand that each thing is accessed as an offset. The same goes for writing over the contents of the map:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">write(minecraft_start + mc_map_offset)
</code></pre>
<h2><a class="header" href="#summary-1" id="summary-1">Summary</a></h2>
<p>Things are laid-out in memory in a linear format. Each location in memory can be addressed by an address (usually referred to in hex). At each address you can store data and read data. All-in-all, we have a large place that we can read and write too using numbers as our address. We usually refer to locations as offsets of known labels.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#assembly" id="assembly">Assembly</a></h1>
<p>Following our talk on section on bits, we can now address the computer
looking section of our chapter, <strong>Assembly</strong>.</p>
<p>An assembly language, better referred to as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture">ISA</a>, is the lowest level of instructions that run on a computer. These instructions, or operations on data, are predefined by the hardware you use! At the the lowest level, each instruction in a ISA is a combination of logic gates that you have already learned. Before continuing, watch this 15 minutes video on what an architecture is by Yan <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jc0eSnrzF4">here</a>.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>As far as ISA's go, there are two types:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer">RISC</a>: Reduced Instruction Set Computer</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_instruction_set_computer">CISC</a>: Complex Instruction Set Computer</li>
</ul>
<p>RISC and CISC are competitors and mostly differ in the side-effects their instructions have on memory. If you are interested in this difference, then you can read what <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/risc/risccisc/">Stanford has to say on the matter</a>, but its not required. For this handbook we will be only using and referring to assembly for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64">Intel x86_64</a>.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#intel-x86_64-assembly" id="intel-x86_64-assembly">Intel x86_64 Assembly</a></h2>
<p>The assembly language we will be studying in this handbook is by no means the best assembly language to start with. Ideally, we would've started with a RISC architecture because they are easier to learn, but, the world had different ideas. </p>
<p>There is an extremely high probability that you are reading this text on an Intel x86_64 machine. Dell, Lenovo, Apple; they all run x86_64. The only exception is the recent Mac M1 processor, but for the most part, the worlds computers run on the Intel ISA. With that knowledge, we though it was most practical to teach you the most common architecture.</p>
<p>It's time we dive into x86_64, which we will shorthand to <em>x86</em> from now.

<h1><a class="header" href="#programming-languages" id="programming-languages">Programming Languages</a></h1>
<p>A chapter on how programming languages differ, using C, using Python, and preparing 
ourselves for a deeper dive into how the computer works using compiled languages.
Even if you have written C or Python before, I recommend glancing over the sections. </p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#introduction-3" id="introduction-3">Introduction</a></h1>
<p>If you are a blossoming computer scientist, it is likely you have heard about the language
<a href="https://www.python.org/about/">Python</a>. With the knowledge of a single language, you think 
realize that there must be many different languages to talk to a computer with. What may
come as something interesting is that there are distinct groups of languages we call
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm">programming paradigms</a>. There are 
distinct programming paradigms, but many are too difficult to understand this early in 
your coding career, so we will only focus on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming">Imperative Programming</a>.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#imperative-programming" id="imperative-programming">Imperative Programming</a></h2>
<p>Imperative programming is what many refer to as normal programming. You think in variables
like in math. A simple example is when you want to compute the speed of something. 
You are an advanced enough mammal that you can create a formula (a series of symbols) for
this idea:</p>
<pre><code>speed = distance / time
</code></pre>
<p>Now when you want to compute the speed, you simply assign values to the variables 
<code>distance</code> and <code>time</code> that you specify in the formula. These are parameters:</p>
<pre><code>compute_speed(distance, time):
    speed = distance / time 
    return speed
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, you just assign values:</p>
<pre><code>compute_speed(10, 1)
</code></pre>
<p>Which outputs <code>10</code>. This is imperative. Variables are assigned, functions return values, 
and things work in this linear fashion. All is good. If you care to know what else exists
feel free to read up on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming">declaritive languages</a>, but
it's optional. Now let's talk about the division in imperative languages </p>
<p>Two exist:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compiled Languages</li>
<li>Interpreted Languages </li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#compiled-languages" id="compiled-languages">Compiled Languages</a></h2>
<p>It's likely you've also heard of the language <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a>.
You must be wondering, how is <code>C</code> any different from <code>Python</code>? Why is Python more popular now? Which should
I use? These are all valid questions. Let's start by showing you what <code>C</code> is, then compare it to Python later.</p>
<p><code>C</code> is a compiled language. This means the process of compilation must be done on the language after you write
it. According to <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/c/compilat.htm">ComputerHope</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Compilation</strong> is the process the computer takes to convert a high-level programming language into a machine language that the computer can understand. The software which performs this conversion is called a compiler.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In many ways, this makes sense. You can't just say English things to the computer. It needs to be translated
into something the computer understands, i.e., <code>100101011110101...</code>—binary. You may think this is stupid,
since you already need to convert your high-level ideas into a specific language, then that language gets
translated again. The only reason this current way is more efficient is that it's easier to write
<code>C</code> than it is to write <code>binary</code>. </p>
<p>This means that our code can only work (run) on a computer after it has been compiled into a program. 
Assuming we can convert our high-level idea into C-code, our workflow now looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="4_programming_languages/./c_workflow.jpeg" alt="c_workflow" /></p>
<p><code>C Code</code> -&gt; <code>&lt;compiler&gt;</code> -&gt; <code>Binary Code</code> </p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#diy-c" id="diy-c">DIY C</a></h3>
<p>Let's quickly do a simple example, though you are not sure how to code yet. Take the written code
below and write it into a file with vim: </p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">vim example.c
</code></pre>
<p>write:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main()
{
    printf(&quot;Hello World, from C!\n&quot;);
}
</code></pre>
<p>What is the type of the file we just created? Let's take a look with the <code>file</code> command:
(don't mind the <code>▶</code> shown, that is my custom shell symbol).</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">▶ file example.c
example.c: C source, ASCII text
</code></pre>
<p>It's an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">ASCII</a> text file that the OS identified as a C source file. 
If you are not familiar with ASCII, it's a way to encode numbers as letters and vice versa. 
For example <code>65</code> translate to <code>A</code> and the other way around as well. For now, know that this is just a file
full of readable text.</p>
<p>Now lets <strong>compile</strong> it! <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org">gcc</a> is the GNU (another name for Linux) C Compiler. Let's use it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">gcc example.c -o example 
</code></pre>
<p>We used <code>gcc</code> and told it to name the output as <code>example</code>. You should now see it in the same directory:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">▶ ls
example  example.c
</code></pre>
<p>Now what is the type of <code>example</code>? Let's check:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">▶ file example
example: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, BuildID[sha1]=aeac59bbc04b9845665af0406044181d241f31f6, not stripped
</code></pre>
<p>Wo. That is a lot of information. For now, let's talk about the first segment of text: 
<code>example: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object</code>. This means <code>example</code> is a 64-bit ELF. What is an ELF?
Not a magical creature, but an executable program! Anything that is an <code>ELF</code> is a compiled
program that is ready and in computer language. Let's run it!</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">▶ ./example
Hello World, from C!
</code></pre>
<p>Amazing, it executed as expected.
What else is an ELF? Almost everything we use in the shell. Take for example <code>ls</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">▶ file /bin/ls
/bin/ls: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, BuildID[sha1]=9567f9a28e66f4d7ec4baf31cfbf68d0410f0ae6, stripped
</code></pre>
<p>Yup it's an ELF. We will go deeper into ELF's in the <a href="4_programming_languages/../4_computer_organization/introduction.html">computer organization</a> section.
For now, know it's a compiled program. There are many compiled langauges out there. C and C++ are currently 
the most used. Here are some of the most popular:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_intro.asp">C++</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a></li>
<li><a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/">Swift</a></li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#interpreted-languages" id="interpreted-languages">Interpreted Languages</a></h2>
<p>Unlike <code>C</code>, Python is not compiled (or at least not on the surface). Python is interpreted line-by-line.
This is really nice when you are working fast, because when you compile if there is one mistake in your
code, the entire program will not compile—which means you now have nothing but a C file. In Python,
if the code never executes to that section of the code, then it does not care. In addition, you can
execute entire lines of code independently. This is what makes an interpreted language different from 
a compiled one.</p>
<p>With interpreted languages, the language is fed into an interpreter, which then executes the code.
So similarly to compiled languages, we have a middle man that does some kind of translation; except 
now it's on a line-by-line basis. Let's look at it closer, on the DIY scale.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#diy-python" id="diy-python">DIY Python</a></h3>
<p>Like last time put this in a file: </p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">vim example.py
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-python">#!/usr/bin/env python3
print(&quot;Hello World, from Python!&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>As you can probably tell already, Python is much more concise. This is usually true when comparing
an interpreted language to a compiled one. Now let's see what the type of this file is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">▶ file example.py
example.py: Python script, ASCII text executable
</code></pre>
<p>Yup, like last time it's an ASCII file identified as Python code. Now to make this executable we need
to give it the executable permission:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">chmod +x example.py
</code></pre>
<p>Then we can finally execute it like we did with the earlier example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">▶ ./example.py
Hello World, from Python!
</code></pre>
<p>Now, you must be wondering, how the hell did we just run a file full of readable text? 
Based on what we just learned, that should be impossible. It should have to go through some
sort of middle-man that converts the code into a machine language. Well some magic happened 
that we did not see:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">#!/usr/bin/env python3
</code></pre>
<p>That first line we wrote told the shell to execute this file using the <code>python3</code> command. 
This is equivalent to running the program like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">▶ python3 example.py
Hello World, from Python!
</code></pre>
<p>And what the hell is <code>python3</code>? I think you know...
Note: <code>python3</code> is a symbolic link for <code>python3.6</code></p>
<pre><code>▶ file /usr/bin/python3.6
/usr/bin/python3.6: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, BuildID[sha1]=fc614aa299a924960da33b875fb9cfaa641ea5bc, stripped
</code></pre>
<p>Yup, it's an <code>ELF</code>. This means that the interpreter is indeed a compiled program written in 
a compiled language (C++ in this case). Things make sense again. Since we know the 
interpreter is magical; let's take this one step further. We can actually execute
the interpreter without any initial code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">▶ python3
Python 3.6.9 (default, Oct  8 2020, 12:12:24)
[GCC 8.4.0] on linux
Type &quot;help&quot;, &quot;copyright&quot;, &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;license&quot; for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Executing <code>python3</code> alone should put you in some kind of prompt now. It's ready
to execute things line by line. Try it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">&gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;hello world&quot;)
hello world
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;wow so cool&quot;)
wow so cool
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(4 + 5)
9
</code></pre>
<p>Pretty cool right? It executes things line by line and can even use variables you define.
As you can see, all interpreted languages are built on compiled languages. At the end 
of the day, the computer only understands machine language—remember this. </p>
<p>Here are some popular interpreted languages:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.python.org/about/">Python</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.javascript.com/">Java Script</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/What-is-Bash_003f.html">Bash</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, the shell you have been using is indeed an interpreted language. </p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#speed-comparison" id="speed-comparison">Speed Comparison</a></h2>
<p>The last thing to mention is that because of the nature of executing a program line-by-line,
compiled languages are often <strong>much</strong> faster than interpreted languages. For instance,
let's compare two programs that do the exact same thing in two languages.</p>
<p>You know the deal:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">vim test.c
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main()
{
    int temp = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i &lt; 1000000000; i++);
        temp += 1;
    return temp;
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-bash">gcc test.c -o test
</code></pre>
<p>Now let's write the python version:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">vim test.py
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-python">#!/usr/bin/env python3
def main():
    temp = 0
    for i in range(1000000000):
        temp += 1
    return temp

main()
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-bash">chmod +x test.py
</code></pre>
<p>Now we have two versions, <code>test.py</code> and <code>test</code> -- a compiled vs interpreted race.
Both of these programs run the action <code>&quot;increment temp&quot;</code> <strong>1 billion times</strong>.
For the C program, this is nothing, but for python... well. Let's time it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">▶ time ./test
./test  2.28s user 0.00s system 99% cpu 2.285 total
</code></pre>
<p>The C program took <code>2.28</code> seconds. Let's time the Python one (wait for it!):</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">▶ time ./test.py
./test.py  37.60s user 0.01s system 99% cpu 37.620 total
</code></pre>
<p>The python program took <code>37.60</code> seconds. Wow. Your times may be slightly different,
but the difference being large will be the same. In this case, <code>C</code> was <strong>16 times
faster</strong>. You can see how this gets bad on a larger scale, but I digress.</p>
<p>Let's move on to using these languages. </p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#c" id="c">C</a></h1>
<p>Our compiled language of choice will be <code>C</code> because it is the most fundamental
and widely used compiled language that exists. All languages build on C's
success, so we will start with it.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#learning-to-program-in-c" id="learning-to-program-in-c">Learning to program in C</a></h2>
<p>This is where the handbook does less justice. It's a lengthy process to teach
someone how to program in another language, so I will defer this process to 
an external location. </p>
<p>First, I recommend reading from the <strong>beginning to page 20</strong> in the book 
<code>Hacking: The Art of Exploitation, 2nd Edition</code>. This will give you a 
high-level overview of the structures we use in programming. Next, you
will need to actually learn the general syntax of C. I am not asking you
to become a master, but you must learn the fundamentals. </p>
<p>Here are some tutorials I recommend, either will take at least a week or more to complete,
but you got this. You are a hacker now. </p>
<p>Tutorials, choose one:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.learn-c.org/">Learn-C</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.programiz.com/c-programming">Programiz</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Before starting on the actual tutorial, it may be helpful to read the other
three sub-sections associated with this section, i.e.:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="4_programming_languages/./write_c.html">Writing Code</a></li>
<li><a href="4_programming_languages/./compilation.html">Compiling &amp; Running Code</a></li>
<li><a href="4_programming_languages/./debugging_c.html">Debugging Code</a></li>
</ul>
<p>They are only there to give you suggestions on good ways to write, compile, and debug
from my personal experience. These will help you write code faster while you learn, but
may not be necessary since many tutorials have you program in the browser now.</p>

<h1><a class="header" href="#writing-code" id="writing-code">Writing Code</a></h1>
<p>Considering you have done the <a href="4_programming_languages/../2_operating_systems/terminal.html">Terminal</a> section 
in the Operating Systems chapter, you already know about vim: the universal 
terminal based text editor. I stand by this notion that <code>vim</code> is the supreme editor
when it comes to it's awesome key-bindings, but vim lacks features that other
editors have made normal. For this very reason, you need to use plugins 
with vim to make it actually usable. In this section, I show you how to edit
C code faster and better.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#using-plugins-with-vim" id="using-plugins-with-vim">Using plugins with Vim</a></h2>
<p>Get <code>Vundle</code> installed so we can add plugins. Go to their repo <a href="https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim#quick-start">here</a>
After you have it installed, you will have a default looking <code>.vimrc</code> that should look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-vim">set nocompatible              &quot; be iMproved, required
filetype off                  &quot; required

&quot; set the runtime path to include Vundle and initialize
set rtp+=~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
call vundle#begin()
&quot; alternatively, pass a path where Vundle should install plugins
&quot;call vundle#begin('~/some/path/here')

&quot; let Vundle manage Vundle, required
Plugin 'VundleVim/Vundle.vim'

&quot; The following are examples of different formats supported.
&quot; Keep Plugin commands between vundle#begin/end.
&quot; plugin on GitHub repo
Plugin 'tpope/vim-fugitive'
&quot; plugin from http://vim-scripts.org/vim/scripts.html
&quot; Plugin 'L9'
&quot; Git plugin not hosted on GitHub
Plugin 'git://git.wincent.com/command-t.git'
&quot; git repos on your local machine (i.e. when working on your own plugin)
Plugin 'file:///home/gmarik/path/to/plugin'
&quot; The sparkup vim script is in a subdirectory of this repo called vim.
&quot; Pass the path to set the runtimepath properly.
Plugin 'rstacruz/sparkup', {'rtp': 'vim/'}
&quot; Install L9 and avoid a Naming conflict if you've already installed a
&quot; different version somewhere else.
&quot; Plugin 'ascenator/L9', {'name': 'newL9'}

&quot; All of your Plugins must be added before the following line
call vundle#end()            &quot; required
filetype plugin indent on    &quot; required
&quot; To ignore plugin indent changes, instead use:
&quot;filetype plugin on
&quot;

&quot; Put your non-Plugin stuff after this line
</code></pre>
<p>Before the line: <code>&quot; All of your Plugins must be added before the following line</code>
Add the following:</p>
<pre><code>Plugin 'valloric/youcompleteme'
Plugin 'VundleVim/Vundle.vim'
Plugin 'airblade/vim-gitgutter'
Plugin 'editorconfig/editorconfig-vim'
Plugin 'itchyny/lightline.vim'
Plugin 'junegunn/fzf'
Plugin 'junegunn/fzf.vim'
Plugin 'mattn/emmet-vim'
Plugin 'scrooloose/nerdtree'
Plugin 'scrooloose/syntastic'
Plugin 'scrooloose/nerdcommenter'
</code></pre>
<p>Yeah, it's a series of plugins that make vim usable. The only thing you need to
do in addition to this is install the <code>youcompleteme</code> things to make autocompleting
a thing. Follow their <a href="https://github.com/ycm-core/YouCompleteMe#linux-64-bit">install guide</a>.</p>
<p>After that is all in, feel free to explore what the hell you just installed ;). 
For one, you now have autocompleting, a directory view, and a nice lightline. 
Check it all out. </p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#using-vim-in-another-editor" id="using-vim-in-another-editor">Using Vim in another Editor</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes I don't like to use the command line to do my editing of code. Maybe you feel
the same. When I don't want to use the terminal (usually for bigger or longer-lasting
projects), I use <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">VS Code</a>. 
Don't worry; it is not the regular Visual Studio. This is a pretty minimal open-source editor 
that works on all platforms. Especially Linux. It's very good and I recommend using it.</p>
<p>But to make it <strong>ACTUALLY</strong> usable, it must have vim embedded in it. That's right, vim
key bindings. Go ahead and install this <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim">vim plugin</a>
into your VS Code once you have it installed and setup. </p>
<p>The lists of features in this editor is endless. One of my favorite features 
is that you edit files on a remote machine with ssh in VSCode. It's super seamless 
and makes it feel like you are just editing a local file. 
<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh">Check it out</a>.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#using-a-multiplexer-tmux" id="using-a-multiplexer-tmux">Using a multiplexer (tmux)</a></h2>
<p>Lastly, you are going to want to use some sort of multiplexer when you are editing
code. It helps so you don't need to switch between tabs and such. My setup often
looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="4_programming_languages/./my_setup.png" alt="my_setup" /></p>
<p>In the left I have the source; In the right I have it split to run commands and
see in/output and also have a <code>man</code> page up for commands I don't understand. 
It makes coding in the terminal supa-hot-fire.</p>
<p>This is all made possible with <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki">tmux</a> a terminal
multiplexer. It's very similar to having a terminal that splits this for you. Many
people like to use Terminator for this. I recommend using tmux. It will make you a 
better hacker and is usable on SSH connections. </p>
<p>Install tmux and xclip:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo apt-get install tmux xclip
</code></pre>
<p>Then use the config I have specially made to emulate <code>Terminator</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">vim ~/.tmux.conf
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-conf"># Set tmux to split and move like Terminator

</code></pre>
<p>Usage:</p>
<ul>
<li>Split Vertically: <code>Ctrl+Shift+e</code></li>
<li>Split Horizontally: <code>Ctrl+Shift+o</code></li>
<li>Destroy Pane: <code>Ctrl+d</code></li>
<li>Move between panes with <code>Alt+arrow_key</code>
<ul>
<li>Example: move left: <code>Alt+left_arrow_key</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly, you can now just copy things in your terminal by selecting it with your mouse.
It will automatically copy it while in a <code>tmux</code> session. If you destroy every pane,
it will exit out of the <code>tmux</code> session. Feel free to rebind everything. </p>

<p>Writing code in Python is <em>very</em> similar to writing code in 
any other language, but has the subtle difference of being able
to test ideas quickly in a interactive interpreter. </p>
<p>First, go and follow everything done in the <a href="4_programming_languages/./write_c.html">Writing C</a>
section. This will get you setup with Vim and tmux. </p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#testing-ideas-as-you-go" id="testing-ideas-as-you-go">Testing ideas as you go</a></h2>
<p>Python is very fast to write and even faster to test. For this reason
I recommend almost always writing code in the terminal using vim,
tmux, and a secret new tool called <code>IPython</code>.</p>
<p>First install it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo apt-get install ipython3
</code></pre>
<p>What we just installed is an upgraded interactive python interpreter.
Run it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">ipython3
</code></pre>
<p>Now you are in a nice interpreter:</p>
<pre><code>▶ ipython3
Python 3.6.9 (default, Oct  8 2020, 12:12:24)
Type &quot;copyright&quot;, &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;license&quot; for more information.

</code></pre>
<p>Now you can test ideas quickly and instantly see the output. I recommend
always having this open as a pane when you are writing code. It will
allow you to test ideas very quickly and do other very interesting things.</p>
<p>Assume we have a python file called <code>my_program.py</code>, and it looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def reverse(lst):
    return lst[::-1]
</code></pre>
<p>Yes it's just a function. Now open up <code>ipython3</code> and do this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">In [1]: from my_program import reverse

In [2]: my_lst = [1,2,3,4]

In [3]: reverse(my_lst)
Out[3]: [4, 3, 2, 1]
</code></pre>
<p>Yup, we can directly execute the function inside our file. It makes for good writing.</p>
