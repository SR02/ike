<h2><a class="header" href="#ike-the-systems-hacking-handbook" id="ike-the-systems-hacking-handbook">`Ike: The Systems Hacking Handbook</a></h2>
<p>Welcome to <code>'Ike</code> (pronounced eeh-keh), a handbook to get you to the starting point of hacking. In this
handbook I attempt to take someone who has potentially 0 systems hacking experience and get you to a point
where you can start doing <a href="https://pwn.college">pwn.college</a>. This knowledge will also give you a strong
base to build your hacking knowledge on. </p>
<p>This handbook acts as a &quot;no belt&quot; to &quot;white belt&quot; in hacking as a direct predecessor to pwn.college's 
white to yellow belt education. Though this content was written with <a href="https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/">CTFers</a> in mind,
this content can help any student entering computer science or looking to become a better systems hacker.
Note, this handbook touches on nothing other than systems security at a fundamental level. If you are interested
in web hacking, look elsewhere. </p>
<p>Through this <code>Introduction</code> section, you will find meta-data about the handbook, why it was written,
and what I hope to accomplish with it as well as the target audience. </p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#background" id="background">Background</a></h1>
<h2><a class="header" href="#the-education-gap" id="the-education-gap">The Education Gap</a></h2>
<p>Over the course of my somewhat fruitful CTF career, I've picked up a lot of knowledge for getting started in hacking. I've read many &quot;getting started&quot; guides as well as helped create content for an automated framework to teach people how to pwn (<a href="https://pwn.college">pwn.college</a>). Many of my CTFing peers learned through experience in CTF, but an even larger amount of people who used to be on our team did not. This goes to say, I think there is a small, but impactful, gap between having the ability to follow someone else's &quot;curriculum&quot; and creating one for yourself.</p>
<p>To cope with this education gap, the aforementioned <a href="https://pwn.college">pwn.college</a> was created to help people get to the &quot;yellow belt&quot; level of hacking -- essentially having enough skill to create your own learning curriculum. The one issue is that the class assumes you have <strong>junior year level computer science knowledge</strong> (at Arizona State University). To clarify, that skill level assumes you know how to use Linux, understand C, how binaries work... and much more. For real noobs, like myself when I started hacking, we don't know any of those things yet. This handbook was created to fill that secondary gap. </p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#the-target-audience" id="the-target-audience">The Target Audience</a></h2>
<p>This handbook is targeted at anyone on or below the &quot;junior in college&quot; level of computer science, though even those individuals may find something useful from this handbook. This handbook is intended to give you all the material and direction you need to start pwn.college. After which, it is assumed you will continue your education with the pwn.college teaching platform. Learning from this handbook will have varying difficulty based on the
reader. The people who will have the most efficient/easiest time learning from this handbook look like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Comp. Sci. College Juniors</li>
<li>Comp. Sci. College Freshmen/Sophomores</li>
<li>High School Students </li>
</ol>
<p>This of course assumes that you are in a college program that touches on systems (which it should). Things like C, debugging, memory management, operating systems. These things will make this experience much easier,
but this handbook was made to help people who have not yet had the chance to take those types of classes (or don't have access to it). There the individuals who will learn/benefit the most from this is:</p>
<ol>
<li>High School Students</li>
<li>Comp. Sci. College Freshmen/Sophomores</li>
<li>Comp. Sci. College Juniors </li>
</ol>
<p>In the end, many people can benefit from this, so feel free to go to exact sections if you think you have nothing to gain from the others; however, I do encourage everyone to at least skim each section since you may
find some surprising tutorial/article I reference. </p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#the-handbooks-novelty" id="the-handbooks-novelty">The Handbook's Novelty</a></h2>
<p>As I breifly mentioned <a href="1_introduction/background.html#the-education-gap">above</a>, there exist many places to start practicing pwning and reversing, but not many that will explain the introductory concepts. As an example, taking a look at the <a href="https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/index.html">Nightmare Book's</a> style of teaching. It is layed out into chapters of exploitation techniques, which I like a lot. Each section is a writeup of how to solve a challenge that has the exploitation technique embedded in it. I think this method is extremely effective for learning for those with pre-established skills in Linux, C, and systems. I think this method fails for noobs who are just learning how C really works (on the memory level). In my brain, <em>prepare for what animations look like in my brain</em>, the learning barriers look like this:</p>
<p><strong>Nightmare Method</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="1_introduction/./nightmare-method.jpeg" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>'Ike Method</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="1_introduction/./ike-method.jpeg" alt="" /></p>
<p>The subtle difference here is that I believe the underlying security concept should be educated and learned about through explicit material first, then it should be reinforced with scripting and systems skills. This is not to say I don't like the Nightmare method, I love it, but others need a different one. This book is that different method. </p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#inspiration" id="inspiration">Inspiration</a></h1>
<p>While writing this, and coming up with the idea, I took a lot of inspiration from blogs and posts as well
as entire pages dedicated to the education of CTF knowledge. A few stick out in my mind:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/index.html">Nightmare Book</a>: theme, idea, use of mdbooks</li>
<li><a href="https://ctf-wiki.org/">CTF Wiki</a>: layout, reversing &amp; pwning content</li>
<li><a href="https://pwn.college/">pwn.college</a>: content</li>
<li><a href="https://picoctf.org/">pico.ctf</a>: educating noobs in CTF</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many others that I did not list here, but I will try to link them in as we get through some
of the content that cites them. </p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#the-author" id="the-author">The Author</a></h1>
<p>I'm <a href="https://zionbasque.com">Zion Leonahenahe Basque</a>, but you might know me as <a href="https://mahaloz.re">mahaloz</a>. I'm a CTFer with <a href="https://shellphish.net">Shellphish</a> and a graduate student at <a href="https://sefcom.asu.edu/">Arizona State University SEFCOM</a>. I really hope you enjoy this handbook, as it was a labor of love for those who have asked me for help getting started over the years. I hope you get something useful out of it :). </p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#operating-systems" id="operating-systems">Operating Systems</a></h1>
<p>The chapter on Operating Systems.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#introduction-1" id="introduction-1">Introduction</a></h1>
<h2><a class="header" href="#background-1" id="background-1">Background</a></h2>
<p>To start your journey into binary reversing and exploitation, you first need to understand the platform
on which you reverse and exploit. As you are likely aware, you are currently on an operating system (OS):
likely Windows or MacOS. Generally, people know the difference between these OS, but
to be a good hacker you must understand these differences on a technical level. In future modules
we will talk about MacOS and Windows, but for now Linux will suffice.</p>
<p>What is Linux you may ask? Linux is the operating system of hackers! It is also the OS
that most embedded devices and servers use. Linux is <a href="https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source">open-source</a>,
which means it is also an OS that is easy to develop on and learn (relative 
to the other ones). Right now it might not be clear what you would be developing that is related
to the OS or how it is useful, but it will hopefully be more clear at the end 
of this section.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#linux" id="linux">Linux</a></h2>
<p>To get a better idea of what Linux is, read the first five sections of this 
<a href="https://www.linux.com/what-is-linux/">article</a>. </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Now that you know what a distribution of Linux is, you can be informed that we will be using the mainstream, 
Debian based distribution <a href="https://ubuntu.com/tutorials">Ubuntu</a>. If you have found your way here 
through external hacking tutorials, you be tempted to use <a href="https://www.kali.org/downloads/">Kali Linux</a>, a
similarly Debian based distribution. I'll make the argument that it will be easier to use Ubuntu than Kali,
and for the basis of these tutorials, the up-to-date kernel of Ubuntu is better.</p>
<p>TL;DR: We will use Ubuntu, almost none of the tools on Kali are needed for this.</p>
<p>In the next sub-section, we get Ubuntu.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#virtualization" id="virtualization">Virtualization</a></h1>
<p>Virtualization is the cornerstone of modern operating systems. To virtualize something is 
to create a virtual version of it that does not require hardware. As an example, it's like
running an Android phone on your laptop. The android operating system is supposed to only
be run on phone hardware (for the most part), but yet we can run it on a laptop with 
an <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator">emulator</a>. </p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#virtual-machines" id="virtual-machines">Virtual Machines</a></h1>
<h2><a class="header" href="#what-is-a-virtual-machine" id="what-is-a-virtual-machine">What is a Virtual Machine?</a></h2>
<p>A virtual machine (VM) is a virtualized operating system. Read this 
<a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/virtualization/what-is-a-virtual-machine">article</a> before
continuing. If you are very lazy, you can just watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIVXjl4SwVo">video</a></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>We use VMs, as said in the article, because it is isolated from the host system and 
it allows us to keep our nice comfortable OS on our computer. This means you will
have both your host OS (Windows/MacOS), and this VM of Linux for hacking.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#setting-up-a-vm" id="setting-up-a-vm">Setting up a VM</a></h2>
<p>If you are an ASU student, use VMWare. The school has given access
to it for free. Get it <a href="https://ets.engineering.asu.edu/vmware/">here</a>.
If you are not, <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">Virtualbox</a> works as well.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Now that you have download the software to use a VM, let's actually make an Ubuntu VM.
Follow the tutorial below for the software you are using:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://linuxhint.com/install_ubuntu_vmware_workstation/">VMWare Tutorial</a></li>
<li><a href="https://itsfoss.com/install-linux-in-virtualbox/">Virtual Box Tutorial</a></li>
</ul>
<p>After following the tutorials above, you should have an Ubuntu machine ready to go with a
login </p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#containers" id="containers">Containers</a></h1>
<p>Containers are another level of virtualization that allows for isolated spaces in the kernel
to be created and destroyed without affecting each other. </p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#what-is-a-container" id="what-is-a-container">What is a container?</a></h2>
<p>To get more specific, read what Docker has to say on what a Container is: <a href="https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container">here</a>.
Now you may be wondering, how does this differ from a VM? As an end-user, there is no difference. But as 
far as technicals go, Dockers diagram is a good comparison:</p>
<p><strong>VM:</strong>
<img src="2_operating_systems/./vm.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>Container:</strong>
<img src="2_operating_systems/./container.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>In simple terms, a VM is much more heavy since we need to initialize an entirely new kernel for each VM we make.
In a container, we share the already existent kernel, and using some techinical tricks, we create isolated sections
of the kernel that we then use to create containers (which act as VMs). </p>
<p>TL;DR: contaier light, VM heavy.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#why-use-a-container" id="why-use-a-container">Why use a container?</a></h3>
<p>You be asking yourself, &quot;why use a container?&quot; We already are in a VM, so as far as affecting our host machine, we are
already in the clear. Containers become the most useful when trying to run applications that have dependencies that
we might not have access to in our current version of the VM. For instance, wanting to run an <code>Ubuntu 18.04</code> applicaiton
while in <code>Ubuntu 20.04</code>. You can either pray to the computer gods and hope your dependences still work in the new version,
or you can use a docker container that creates an <code>Ubuntu 18.04</code> environment in it to run. The latter is easier. </p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#docker-the-modern-container" id="docker-the-modern-container">Docker: the modern container</a></h2>
<p>Now that you know what a container is, it's time we set you up to be able to use containers. There are many implementations
of containers, but the one we will use is <a href="https://www.docker.com/why-docker">Docker</a>. Docker is very mainstream and 
has a lot of use across the computer science industry. Take for instance <a href="https://wordpress.com/">Wordpress</a>, which you
have likely heard of or used. It's a platform for building websites for free with a GUI. It also has a lot of 
dependencies and things you need to set up before using it. Wordpress uses Docker, and has made a docker container
that does it all for you. Check it out: <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/wordpress">here</a>. Essentially you can run an entire
wordpress hosting software with a database all with this simple command in a terminal:</p>
<pre><code class="language-docker">docker run wordpress
</code></pre>
<p>Which is a great segway into installing Docker, since it requires use of the <code>command line</code>.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#setting-up-docker" id="setting-up-docker">Setting up docker</a></h2>
<p>We will now install <code>Docker</code> on your <code>Ubuntu VM</code>, so from now on all instructions are pertaining to being inside
you VM. First login to the VM, then open up the terminal. You can do this by either searching applications or 
simple right clicking the desktop and clicking <code>&quot;Open terminal&quot;</code>. This is where the fun begins. Pro-tip,
you can click the copy button in the top left of the code snippets to copy and paste to your terminal.</p>
<p>It's alright if you don't understand all the commands in this section, we will cover using the terminal later.</p>
<p>First, we need to update the list of installable applications. Run:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo apt-get update
</code></pre>
<p>After that, we need to install the dependencies of docker:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo apt-get install \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg-agent \
    software-properties-common
</code></pre>
<p>Next, let's add dockers GPG key so we can get their software:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
</code></pre>
<p>Add the repository:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo add-apt-repository \
   &quot;deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
   $(lsb_release -cs) \
   stable&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, update once more and install:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo apt-get update
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
</code></pre>
<p>Congratulations, you just installed your first command line tool! And quite a powerful one.
Let's verify it works.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#using-docker" id="using-docker">Using docker</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#verification" id="verification">Verification</a></h3>
<p>To verify you actualy have docker running, simply run:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo docker run hello-world
</code></pre>
<p>The output should look something like:</p>
<pre><code>Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the &quot;hello-world&quot; image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

<p>To make things a littler more interesting, let's actually launch an older Ubuntu version <strong>inside</strong> your
current Ubuntu version. Virtualception. Let's first see what version we are on in our machine:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">grep '^VERSION' /etc/os-release
</code></pre>
<p>I'm on <code>Ubuntu 18.04</code>, so my command output this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">VERSION=&quot;18.04.5 LTS (Bionic Beaver)&quot;
VERSION_ID=&quot;18.04&quot;
VERSION_CODENAME=bionic
</code></pre>
<p>You may be on <code>20.04</code> so it will look slightly different. Take a note of the version you are on. </p>
<p>Now let's start an <code>Ubuntu 16.04</code> machine. Run:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">docker run -it ubuntu:16.04
</code></pre>
<p>Since it's the first run it will take a few minutes for it to pull down the Ubuntu image data. 
Once it's done, you should see a waiting prompt that looks like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">root@cadd99990677:/#
</code></pre>
<p>You have now opened a terminal in a virtual Ubuntu. Congratz. Run the same command from earlier in this prompt:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">grep '^VERSION' /etc/os-release
</code></pre>
<p>The output should be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">VERSION=&quot;16.04.7 LTS (Xenial Xerus)&quot;
VERSION_ID=&quot;16.04&quot;
VERSION_CODENAME=xenial
</code></pre>
<p>Pretty cool right? We are inside a virtual machine in a virtual machine (techically a container, but you get the point).
Now type:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">exit
</code></pre>
<p>and hit enter. You will be back to your normal terminal. Amazing! </p>
<p>We will use Docker often. If you are excited about this, you can check out this tutorial: <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-started/02_our_app/">here</a>,
though it is not mandatory. Now it's time to learn how to use <code>Bash</code>, the terminal you typed on earlier. </p>
