# The Terminal

You got a little taste of using the terminal in the last section, but now it's time we
got literate. Expect this section to take a few hours since we will be out-sourcing
work to a few different problems/tutorials across the web. 

For the majority of getting you good with begging parts of Linux, we will be using
the amazing class [The Missing Semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) by MIT. 
We will not be doing the entire class, only the parts that matter the most.

## The Shell 

You can think of the shell as the terminal you used earlier. The shell is your
text interface into the computer. It allows you to do things quickly and powerfully.
To become a good hacker, you must first learn how to navigate and use a shell. 

To do this, we will now jump to the earlier mentioned MIT course on hacking
tools. Read **and do the exercises** of this lesson: [Topic 1: The Shell](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/course-shell/#topic-1-the-shell).
If you do not like reading, you can also find the lecture at the top of that page. 
This will take some time, so come back here when you are done. 

*take the time to do the exercises before moving on, it will help*

## Shell Scripting 

At this point, it should start becoming clearer that each shell has it's own
scripting language that makes automation very easy. Hacking often involves
repetitive tasks and doing things on a massive level from a shell. Let's
learn how to use *scripting* (using the language) in a powerful way.

Like last time, Read **and do the exercises** of this lesson: [Topic 2: Shell Tools](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/shell-tools/)
This will take some time, so come back here when you are done. 
## Using VIM

Often, after scripting and finding your way to files in your filesystem you
need to edit them. Currently, you should have no idea how to edit files in your terminal, but we
are going to change that now. Hackers need to work fast, and that means writing code directly
from the same interface you use to run it. The terminal is this place. To edit things
fast, we use a quaint program called [VIM](https://www.vim.org/) -- it looks old and feels old,
but it is very powerful. 

Like earlier, Read **and do the exercises** of this lesson: [Topic 3: Editors](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/editors/)
This will take some time, so come back here when you are done. 

After this, you will be quite a powerful user.
