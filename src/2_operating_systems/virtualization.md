# Virtualization

Virtualization is the cornerstone of modern operating systems. To virtualize something is 
to create a virtual version of it that does not require hardware. As an example, it's like
running an Android phone on your laptop. The android operating system is supposed to only
be run on phone hardware (for the most part), but yet we can run it on a laptop with 
an [emulator](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator).
