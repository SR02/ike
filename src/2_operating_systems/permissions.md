# Permissions

The permission to do something is a major component of hacking. Often, we are trying to escelate
our privligae in whatever scenario that is. This can mean becoming the admin of a computer you don't own, 
or simply being able to access restricted things in a video game. Following in this nature, files
in the Linux operating system have permissions.

To learn how they work, read [this](https://linuxcommand.org/lc3_lts0090.php). It should be easier 
and faster than the earlier sections, considering you may have already encountered permissions in
your own system.
