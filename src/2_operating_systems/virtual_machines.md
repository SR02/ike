# Virtual Machines

## What is a Virtual Machine?

A virtual machine (VM) is a virtualized operating system. Read this 
[article](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/virtualization/what-is-a-virtual-machine) before
continuing. If you are very lazy, you can just watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIVXjl4SwVo)

We use VMs, as said in the article, because it is isolated from the host system and 
it allows us to keep our nice comfortable OS on our computer. This means you will
have both your host OS (Windows/MacOS), and this VM of Linux for hacking.

## Setting up a VM 

If you are an ASU student, use VMWare. The school has given access
to it for free. Get it [here](https://ets.engineering.asu.edu/vmware/).
If you are not, [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) works as well.

Now that you have download the software to use a VM, let's actually make an Ubuntu VM.
Follow the tutorial below for the software you are using:
- [VMWare Tutorial](https://linuxhint.com/install_ubuntu_vmware_workstation/)
- [Virtual Box Tutorial](https://itsfoss.com/install-linux-in-virtualbox/)

After following the tutorials above, you should have an Ubuntu machine ready to go with a
login.
