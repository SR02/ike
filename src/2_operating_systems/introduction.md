# Introduction

## Background 
To start your journey into binary reversing and exploitation, you first need to understand the platform
on which you reverse and exploit. As you are likely aware, you are currently on an operating system (OS):
likely Windows or MacOS. Generally, people know the difference between these OS, but
to be a good hacker you must understand these differences on a technical level. In future modules
we will talk about MacOS and Windows, but for now Linux will suffice.

What is Linux you may ask? Linux is the operating system of hackers! It is also the OS
that most embedded devices and servers use. Linux is [open-source](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source),
which means it is also an OS that is easy to develop on and learn (relative 
to the other ones). Right now it might not be clear what you would be developing that is related
to the OS or how it is useful, but it will hopefully be more clear at the end 
of this section.

## Linux

To get a better idea of what Linux is, read the first five sections of this 
[article](https://www.linux.com/what-is-linux/).

Now that you know what a distribution of Linux is, you can be informed that we will be using the mainstream, 
Debian based distribution [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials). If you have found your way here 
through external hacking tutorials, you be tempted to use [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/downloads/), a
similarly Debian based distribution. I'll make the argument that it will be easier to use Ubuntu than Kali,
and for the basis of these tutorials, the up-to-date kernel of Ubuntu is better.

TL;DR: We will use Ubuntu, almost none of the tools on Kali are needed for this.

In the next sub-section, we get Ubuntu.
