# C

Our compiled language of choice will be `C` because it is the most fundamental
and widely used compiled language that exists. All languages build on C's
success, so we will start with it.

## Learning to program in C

This is where the handbook does less justice. It's a lengthy process to teach
someone how to program in another language, so I will defer this process to 
an external location. 

First, I recommend reading from the **beginning to page 20** in the book 
`Hacking: The Art of Exploitation, 2nd Edition`. This will give you a 
high-level overview of the structures we use in programming. Next, you
will need to actually learn the general syntax of C. I am not asking you
to become a master, but you must learn the fundamentals. 

Here are some tutorials I recommend, either will take at least a week or more to complete,
but you got this. You are a hacker now. 

Tutorials, choose one:
- [Learn-C](https://www.learn-c.org/)
- [Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/c-programming)

Before starting on the actual tutorial, it may be helpful to read the other
three sub-sections associated with this section, i.e.:
- [Writing Code](./write_c.md)
- [Compiling & Running Code](./compilation.md)
- [Debugging Code](./debugging_c.md)

They are only there to give you suggestions on good ways to write, compile, and debug
from my personal experience. These will help you write code faster while you learn, but
may not be necessary since many tutorials have you program in the browser now.

**OK**, start the tutorial and move on to the Python section when you are done.
