# Introduction

## `Ike: The Systems Hacking Handbook

Welcome to `'Ike` (pronounced eeh-keh), a handbook to get you to the starting point of hacking. In this
handbook I attempt to take someone who has potentially 0 systems hacking experience and get you to a point
where you can start doing [pwn.college](https://pwn.college). This knowledge will also give you a strong
base to build your hacking knowledge on. 

This handbook acts as a "no belt" to "white belt" in hacking as a direct predecessor to pwn.college's 
white to yellow belt education. Though this content was written with [CTFers](https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/) in mind,
this content can help any student entering computer science or looking to become a better systems hacker.
Note, this handbook touches on nothing other than systems security at a fundamental level. If you are interested
in web hacking, look elsewhere. 

Through this `Introduction` section, you will find meta-data about the handbook, why it was written,
and what I hope to accomplish with it as well as the target audience.
