# `Ike: The Systems Hacking Handbook

## Introduction

Welcome to `'Ike`! This handbook is intended to take those with 0 system hacking experience (that's right 0), and get them to an entry level point within the [pwn.college](https://pwn.college) ecosystem. By following these steps, you can establish a strong base upon which to build your future hacking knowledge on. This process will essentially provide you with your white belt in hacking (at a system level) which will only be enhanced within the subsequent pwn.college program. While this handbook leans into the CTF atmosphere commonly seen on sites like [CTFTime](https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/), the content should prove insightful to those curious individuals with no CTF experience (if you are looking for web skills, look somehwere else :D). If you
get some usage out of this handbook, I ask you to hmu with a star on the [github repo](https://github.com/mahaloz/ike), so I know people actually use 
this, lol.

Through this `Introduction` section, you will find meta-data about the handbook, why it was written,
and what I hope to accomplish with it as well as the target audience. 

## About

I, [Zion Leonahenahe Basque](https://zionbasque.com), initially wrote this for [pwndevils](https://pwndevils.com/)
recruits because often we got people who lacked the skills to start pwn.college, but had the drive. These were
often Freshman or Sophomore's in college who had not yet taken upper-level computer science classes. I had a 
special perspective on this because I've been on the pwndevils leadership for a few years, enough to learn
what often held these underclassmen back and then construct personal plans for each student. I wrote this as
an attempt to make a more general workplan to get to a starting level in hacking. After writing
more of this though, I tried to target those who had not even gotten to college yet. I hope you enjoy it. If you
find any spelling errors or have suggestions, feel free to PR me on [github](https://github.com/mahaloz/ike).
