# Inspiration

While writing this, and coming up with the idea, I took a lot of inspiration from blogs and posts as well
as entire pages dedicated to the education of CTF knowledge. A few stick out in my mind:

- [Nightmare Book](https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/index.html): theme, idea, use of mdbooks
- [CTF Wiki](https://ctf-wiki.org/): layout, reversing & pwning content
- [pwn.college](https://pwn.college/): content
- [pico.ctf](https://picoctf.org/): educating noobs in CTF

There are many others that I did not list here, but I will try to link them in as we get through some
of the content that cites them.
