# Overview & Schedule

## Overview 
We will cover as few concepts as possible to make you dangerous enough to start down a systems
hacking journey. I will usually use external tutorials embedded in this one to get ideas, 
skills, or setups done quickly. This handbook acts as duct tape for all those tutorials. 

As seen in the table of contents on the left, we go through 5 major topics:
- Operating Systems
  - ASU Equiv: CSE330,365. Overviews what makes something an operating system, how we can 
    virtualize them, and how we use them in hacking. Includes a set up for containers
    and VMs.
- Programming Languages
  - ASU Equiv: CSE340,240. Overviews what makes something a programming language, then covers
    a interpreted and compiled language that are commonly used for hacking. This includes
    how to use them efficiently. 
- Computer Organization 
  - ASU Equiv: CSE230. Overviews the internals of computing and how we organize them, 
    including memory layout, assembly (x86), and the types of executable file types
    you will find in the wild. 
- Processes & Debugging
  - ASU Equiv: CSE330,240. Overviews how processes work in Linux and generally. Includes
    learning how to trace, debug, and understand running process. Also has a small intro
    to using Python to mess with running processes. 
- Security Concepts
  - ASU Equiv: CSE365. Does a small dive into some common security concepts that will
    help new hackers think about problems in different ways. Highly inspired by Adam
    Doupe's CSE365.

## How use this handbook
To efficiently use this handbook you should be prepared to follow various links across the web that
I've curated with time. Most links I use are often for things that are more copy-paste-and-follow like.
As an example, in the next section, I'll have you install a Virtual Machine. In that section I use
an external link to have you install it so I don't duplicate work that is already one well. Other things
like using more complex stuff will usually be covered in the handbook. 

Another thing to note is the use of the Dinkus within this text:
```
* * *
```
Whenever you see this symbol it means there is link you will need to follow between the text above 
and below it. That link will take more than 15 minutes to complete. As an example, in the next 
section's introduction I place a link to "What is Linux." I estimate that you will take around
15 minutes or more of time to read that link before progressing onto the next section. Take your
time with the reading, its the absolute minimum you need to read to get that chapters topic. 

Lastly, at the end each section, excluding this one, you can find a practice challenge-set that
will test your knowledge on that chapter. It is highly recommended that you complete all the 
challenges the chapter asks for before you move on to the next chapter. Most of our challenges
currently can be found on [dojo.pwn.college](https://dojo.pwn.college/challenges)

## Work in Progress 

The following sections are still being worked on: 

WIP:
- Programming Languages (50% complete)
- Processes & Debugging (25% complete)
- Security Concepts (0% complete)
