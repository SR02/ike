# Overview & Schedule

## Overview 
We will cover as few concepts as possible to make you dangerous enough to start down a systems
hacking journey. I will usually use external tutorials embedded in this one to get ideas, 
skills, or setups done quickly. This handbook acts as duct tape for all those tutorials. 

As seen in the table of contents on the left, we go through 5 major
- Operating Systems
  - ASU Equiv: CSE330,365. Overviews what makes something an operating system, how we can 
    virtualize them, and how we use them in hacking. Includes a set up for containers
    and VMs.
- Programming Languages
  - ASU Equiv: CSE340,240. Overviews what makes something a programming language, then covers
    a interpreted and compiled language that are commonly used for hacking. This includes
    how to use them efficiently. 
- Computer Organization 
  - ASU Equiv: CSE230. Overviews the internals of computing and how we organize them, 
    including memory layout, assembly (x86), and the types of executable file types
    you will find in the wild. 
- Processes & Debugging
  - ASU Equiv: CSE330,240. Overviews how processes work in Linux and generally. Includes
    learning how to trace, debug, and understand running process. Also has a small intro
    to using Python to mess with running processes. 
- Security Concepts
  - ASU Equiv: CSE365. Does a small dive into some common security concepts that will
    help new hackers think about problems in different ways. Highly inspired by Adam
    Doupe's CSE365.

## Work in Progress 

The following sections are still being worked on, so a schedule is not yet ready for this
whole handbook. Instead, do them as they come for now :).
