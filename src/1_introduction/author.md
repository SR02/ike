# The Author

I'm [Zion Leonahenahe Basque](https://zionbasque.com), but you might know me as [mahaloz](https://mahaloz.re). I'm a CTFer with [Shellphish](https://shellphish.net) and a graduate student at [Arizona State University SEFCOM](https://sefcom.asu.edu/). I really hope you enjoy this handbook, as it was a labor of love for those who have asked me for help getting started over the years. I hope you get something useful out of it :).
